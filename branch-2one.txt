first i cloned git remote repository by using this command. git clone <https://github.com/orphanboy028/my-first-git-practice-project.git>
Checked out local branch using this command -- git branch
Checked out remote branch using this command -- git branch -r
Checked out all branch local and remote using this command -- git branch -a
there was only one tracking branch which master branch because master branch is our default branch on githum remote repositorty. 
If any other branch was the default branch then that branch would have been our tracking branch when we cloned the remote repository.
in our working directory shows only master branch file because only master branch is our tracking branch
For new-branch-1 file we need to checkout on this branch. for checkout <branch name>
After checkout at this branch, this branch will also become a tracking branch.
for checking tracking branch git branch -vv
after this i will work on git fetch and pull
